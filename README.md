# Array
An array in C is a fixed-size collection of similar data items stored in contiguous memory locations. It can be used to store the collection of primitive data types such as int, char, float, etc., and also derived and user-defined data types such as pointers, structures, etc.

In C, we have to declare the array like any other variable before using it. We can declare an array by specifying its name, the type of its elements, and the size of its dimensions. When we declare an array in C, the compiler allocates the memory block of the specified size to the array name.
